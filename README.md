🇻🇳 Hailing from Vietnam with deep ties to Japan 🇯🇵, where I've called home for nearly 14 years. My journey in Japan began in 2009 when I enrolled at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Oita, Kyushu island. The allure of Oita was so strong that I decided to stay after graduation. During my time there, I had the privilege of working at Wancher Inc., where I served as a sales manager and led the marketing team, focusing on managing e-commerce online stores selling Japanese writing instruments.

🏙️ A new adventure beckoned, leading me to Tokyo, where I transitioned into an accountant role at Bollore Logistics, a renowned French logistics company. Here, I managed accounts receivable and accounts payable, gaining invaluable experience.

👩‍👧‍👦 My journey took an exciting turn when I welcomed my second child, and during my childcare leave, I stumbled upon the captivating world of data science. This led me to embark on a transformative nine-week data science bootcamp at Le Wagon, where I acquired invaluable knowledge and skills.

🚀 The highlight of this journey was our final project, Siesta Sentry: a Drowsiness Detector, which I developed with my talented teammates. It revealed the limitless possibilities of data. Now, I'm poised to continue this remarkable voyage, exploring the boundless potential of data to reshape our world. Let's connect and explore together! 📊🌐
